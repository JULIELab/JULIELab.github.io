# Benjamin Redling

I've moved: I'm working for the Kompetenz- und Service-Zentrum / competence  and service centre (KSZ) of the faculty of mathematics and informatics now. But I'm still supporting the JULIE Lab until the end of 2022.

Professionally working in IT since 1999, I joined Prof. Hahn's group in November 2006 as a system administrator.

Over the years I maintained a small FC-SAN, met Solaris with SAM-FS, planned and administred two compute clusters which I heavily upgraded all by myself, introduced the SLURM batch scheduler and a ganeti cluster for virtualization.
Coped with the rough edges of frameworks depending on CUDA installations, the quirks of untrusted containers and the pros and cons of systemd.

Currently I have to get familiar with jitsi, ceph, puppet and much more.

## Recent Working Experience

* Proxmox
* ArangoDB cluster
* Setup of ElasticSearch clusters
* SLURM HPC cluster

* Basic Linux infrastructure (NFS file server, OpenLDAP, ZFS, DRBD)
* Web infrastructure (Apache httpd, nginx, ...)
* Monitoring (Check_MK)
* Virtualization (Ganeti, KVM, Proxmox VE, docker, podman, Singularity)
* Configuration management and orchestration via Ansible and basic shell scripting
