# Benjamin Redling

Professionally working in IT since 1999, I joined Prof. Hahn's group in November 2006 as a system administrator.

Over the years I maintained a small FC-SAN, met Solaris with SAM-FS, planned and administred two compute clusters which I heavily upgraded all by myself, introduced the SLURM batch scheduler and a ganeti cluster for virtualization.

Currently I have to cope with the rough edges of frameworks depending on CUDA installations, the quirks of untrusted containers and the pros and cons of systemd.

## Recent Working Experience

* SLURM HPC cluster
* Setup and tuning of PostgreSQL installations
* Basic Linux infrastructure (NFS file server, OpenLDAP, ZFS, DRBD)
* Web infrastructure (Apache httpd, nginx, ...)
* Monitoring (Check_MK)
* Setup of ElasticSearch clusters
* Virtualization (Ganeti, KVM, Proxmox VE, docker, podman, Singularity)
* Configuration management and orchestration via Ansible and basic shell scripting
* Basic Python and Bash/Shell knowledge
