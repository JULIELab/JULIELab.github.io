During my studies of computer science between 2002 and 2009 with the major subject of artifical intelligence I chose the minor subject of linguistics. This background led me to computational linguistics where I began my work as a research assistent in 2009. Since my time at the JULIE Lab as a PhD candidate I have been working on information extraction and information retrieval in the biomedical domain. In this line of research I worked on the semantic search engine [SeMedico](http://semedico.org/) which led me deeper into the fields of gene name recognition and normalization and into participating in the TREC Precision Medicine challenge in 2018 and 2019. Additionally, I am working with molecular and cell biologists by providing automatically extracting knowledge about gene interactions from the literature.
