# About Us

The Jena University Language & Information Engineering Lab (JULIE Lab) focusses on automatic text analysis and its applications. We work in multiple domains, languages and genres, including biomedical clinical, ecological and economical texts as well as the digital humanities. While our emphasis is on building real-world natural language systems, we also value a methodologically sound basis in terms of language technology tools and resources. Our members are heavily engaged in developing syntactic, semantic and discourse processors, as well as domain-specific knowledge resources (ontologies).This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

Over the years, our team has gained considerable international reputation and a strong external visibility. JULIE Lab is involved in various national and international research projects and collaborations. We invite excellent students and graduates, from Germany and abroad, to join our Lab and contribute to our vision of building systems that exceed the capability of humans to analyze large volumes of text and further scientific discoveries.
