Here you find the resources which we offer for download.

For further questions contact [julielab@listserv.uni-jena.de](mailto:julielab@listserv.uni-jena.de)

### Corpora

[GeneReg](GeneReg.html) - abstracts dealing with the regulation of gene expression in the model organism E. coli

[FSU-PRGE](FSU_PRGE.html) - The FSU PRotein GEne corpus

### Software

[JCoRe NLP tool suite](JCoRe.html) - for the application purposes of semantic search, information extraction and text mining

[UIMA type system](https://github.com/JULIELab/jcore-projects) - a annotation type system which covers formal document structure and document meta information as well as the linguistic levels of morphology, syntax and semantics

GeNo - system for gene name normalization

### Models

All models that we provide are integrated in our JCoRe tool set. However, some of them might be usable outside of JCoRe.

Please find the respective JCoRe repository on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/JULIELab/jcore-projects).

The appropriate models are then stored under **src/main/resources/de/julielab/jcore/ae/.../model/** if you want to download them separately.

### Survey on Use of Active Learning

In February 2009, Fredrik Olsson (SICS, Schweden) and Katrin Tomanek arranged a web survey to analyze and understand the extend to which Active Learning has been used to support the annotation of textual data in context of natural language processing. Moreover, we aimed at finding out about the reasons to why or why not AL has been found applicable to a specific task.

The results of the survey were presented at the Workshop on Active Learning for NLP at NAACL, June 2009 and are published in the workshop proceedings:

Katrin Tomanek and Fredrik Olsson. <u>A Web Survey on the Use of Active Learning to support Annotation of Text Data</u>. *Proc. Workshop on Active Learning for NLP at NAACL 2009*, 2009. [[bib](http://aclweb.org/anthology-new/W/W09/W09-1906.bib)] [[pdf](http://aclweb.org/anthology-new/W/W09/W09-1906.pdf)]

The survey data can be downloaded here:
* plain survey as presented to the participants [PDF](http://www.julielab.de/coling_multimedia/de/downloads/AL+Survey/survey_plain.pdf)
* answers part I: answers of participants completed the survey [PDF](http://www.julielab.de/coling_multimedia/de/downloads/AL+Survey/survey_report_answers1.pdf)
* answers part II: free form answers of participants completing the survey (due to anomymization issues, answers to last question removed) [PDF](http://www.julielab.de/coling_multimedia/de/downloads/AL+Survey/survey_report_answers2_anonymous.pdf)

If you are interested in the raw survey data (which is in some kind of XLS format), please send a mail to [Katrin Tomanek](mailto:katrin.tomanek@uni-jena.de).
