# Benjamin Redling

Professionally working in IT since 1999, I joined Prof. Hahn's group in November 2006 as a system administrator.

Over the years I maintained a FC-SAN, had to cope with Solaris with SAM-FS, planned and administred two compute clusters which I heavily upgraded all by myself, introduced the SLURM batch scheduler and a ganeti cluster for virtualization.

Just recently I started to climb the rough edges of CUDA installations for Deep Learning and after a month of painful doing it "the hard way" happily recommend using the Anaconda Python distribution.

### Recent Working Experience
* Installation and maintenance of the groups SLURM cluster
* Setup and tuning of PostgreSQL installations
* Basic Linux infrastructure (NFS4 file server, OpenLDAP, etc.)
* Monitoring with Check_MK
* Setup of ElasticSearch clusters
* Planning, coaching a complex installation and on-going maintenance of the groups Ganeti (KVM/DRBD) cluster
* Supervision of student assistants
* Configuration management and orchestration via Ansible and basic shell scripting
* Basic Python knowledge
