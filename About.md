# About Us


Until the end of 2022, the Jena University Language & Information Engineering Lab (JULIE Lab) was a chair for computational linguistics at the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena. 

It focussed on automatic text analysis and its applications. Worked in multiple domains, languages and genres, including biomedical, clinical, ecological and economical texts as well as the digital humanities. Emphasis was on building real-world natural language systems and a methodologically sound basis in terms of language technology tools and resources. The alumni were heavily engaged in developing syntactic, semantic and discourse processors, as well as domain-specific knowledge resources (ontologies).
