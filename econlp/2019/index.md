# ECONLP 2019 – 2nd Workshop on Economics and Natural Language Processing

## Description
After the successful launch of the [Workshop on Economics and Natural Language Processing (ECONLP) @ ACL 2018](https://julielab.de/econlp/2018) in Melbourne, Australia (http://aclweb.org/anthology/W18-31), a follow-up event is proposed for 2019 at one of our major conference events. This workshop addresses the increasing relevance of natural language processing (NLP) for regional, national and international economy, both in terms of already operational language technology products and systems, as well as newly emerging methodologies and techniques reflecting the requirements at the intersection of economics and NLP. The focus of the workshop will be on the many ways, how NLP influences business relations and procedures, economic transactions, and the roles of human and computational actors involved in commercial activities. 
Papers submitted to this workshop should address (not excluding other topic areas of relevance for the workshop theme):
* NLP-based (stock) market analytics, e.g., prediction of economic performance indicators (trend prediction, performance forecasting, etc.), by analyzing verbal statements of enterprises, businesses, companies, and associated legal or administrative actors
* NLP-based product analytics, e.g., based on social and mass media monitoring, summarizing reviews, classifying and mining complaint messages and other (non)verbal types of customer reactions to products or services
* NLP-based customer analytics, e.g., client profiling, tracking product/company preferences, screening customer reviews or complaints, identifying high-influentials in economy-related communication networks
* NLP-based organization/enterprise analytics (e.g., tracing and altering social images of organizational actors, risk prediction, fraud analysis, predictive analysis of annual business, sustainability and auditing reports)
* Market sentiments and emotions as evident from consumers’ and enterprises’ verbal behavior and their communication strategies about products and services
* Competitive intelligence services based on NLP tooling
* Relationship and interaction between quantitative (structured) economic data (e.g., contained sales databases and associated time series data) and qualitative (unstructured verbal) economic data (press releases, newswire streams, social media contents, etc.) 
* Information management based on the content-based organization, packaging and archiving of verbal communication streams of organizations and enterprises (emails, meeting minutes, business letters, internal reporting, etc.)
* Credibility and trust models for business agents involved in the economic process (e.g., as traders, sellers, advertisers) extracted from text/opinion mining their current communication as well as historic legacy data
* Deceptive or fake information recognition related to economic objects (such as products, advertisements, etc.) or economic actors (such as industries, companies, etc.), including opinion spam targeting or emanating from economic actors and processes
* Verbally fluent software agents (chat bots for sales and marketing) as reliable actors in economic processes serving business interests, e.g., embodying models of persuasion, information biases, fair trading
* Enterprise search engines (e-commerce, e-marketing)
* Consumer search engines, market monitors, product/service recommender systems
* Client-supplier interaction platforms (e.g., portals, helps desks, newsgroups) and transaction support systems based on written or spoken natural language communication
* Multi-media and multi-modality interaction platforms, including written/spoken language channels, supporting economic processes
* Specialized modes of information extraction and text mining in economic domains, e.g., temporal event or transaction mining
* Information aggregation from single sources (e.g., review summaries, automatic threading)
* Text generation in economic domains, e.g., review generation, complaint response generation
* Ontologies for economics and adaptation of general-domain lexicons for economic NLP
* Corpora and annotations policies (guidelines, metadata schemata, etc.) for economic NLP
* Economy-specific text genres (business reports, sustainability reports, auditing documents, product reviews, economic newswire, business letters, law documents, etc.) and their usage for NLP
* Dedicated software resources for economic NLP (e.g., NER taggers, sublanguage parsers, pipelines for processing economic discourse)

### Organizers’ Research Interests, Areas of Expertise, and Experience in Organizing Workshops

**Udo Hahn** – Jena University Language & Information Engineering (JULIE) Lab, Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena, Germany (chair)
https://julielab.de/Staff/Hahn 

Udo Hahn is a full professor for Computational Linguistics at FSU Jena (Germany) where he heads the Jena University Language & Information Engineering (JULIE) Lab (www.julielab.de). He holds a PhD from the Information Science Department at the University of Konstanz (Germany). His research interests focus on NLP applications for the life and natural sciences, mainly information extraction and text mining, organizational emotion analysis, knowledge integration and aggregation from structured and unstructured data (incl. text summarization), annotation science (active learning), ontology and multilingual terminology engineering, as well as software engineering for NLP. He has been co-organizing 11 workshops in total. Among them four workshops for ACL (the 1st ECONLP workshop @ ACL 2018, as well as workshops on Automatic Summarization @ ANLP-NAACL 2000 and ACL 2002, and the BioNLP 2002 workshop @ ACL 2002), the KR-MED 2004 workshop @ KR 2004 (for AMIA), the SMBM 2005 and 2010 workshops on Semantic Mining in Biomedicine, the “UIMA for NLP” workshops @ LREC 2008 and LREC 2010.
