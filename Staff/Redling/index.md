# Benjamin Redling

Professionally working in IT since 1999, I joined Prof. Hahn's group in November 2006 as a system administrator.

Over the years I maintained a small FC-SAN, met Solaris with SAM-FS, planned and administred two compute clusters which I heavily upgraded all by myself, introduced the SLURM batch scheduler and a ganeti cluster for virtualization.

Currently I have to cope with the rough edges of frameworks depending on CUDA installations and the quirks of untrusted containers.

## Recent Working Experience

* Installation and maintenance of the groups SLURM cluster
* Setup and tuning of PostgreSQL installations
* Basic Linux infrastructure (NFS4 file server, OpenLDAP, Btrfs, ZFS)
* Web infrastructure (Apache httpd, reverse proxying, Jetty, Certificates,  
* Monitoring with Check_MK
* Setup of ElasticSearch clusters
* Maintenance of the groups Ganeti (KVM/DRBD) cluster
* Configuration management and orchestration via Ansible and basic shell scripting
* Basic Python knowledge
