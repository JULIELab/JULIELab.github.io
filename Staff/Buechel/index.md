After studying physics, sociology and German philology at Jena University, I joined Prof. [Udo Hahn](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=pSziNSkAAAAJ&hl=de)'s Group in summer 2016. Since then my work focuses on modeling emotional reactions to language on different linguistic levels (words, sentences, and texts). A distinguishing feature of our research is the close connection to psychology in terms of data sets and, in particular, formal representations of affective states. As such, my long-term goal is to push sentiment analysis away from its narrow focus on positive vs. negative feelings only but instead introducing more expressive models of emotion from psychological theory. I am also interested in applying our resulting methodologies to questions asked within the humanities and social sciences.
In summer 2018, I spent three months as a visiting scholar at the University of Pennsylvania working together with [Lyle Ungar](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=KCiDjbkAAAAJ&hl=de&oi=ao).
